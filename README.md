# Hypertension Detection App

## Overview

This project is a web application for detecting the risk of hypertension based on user inputs. The application uses a machine learning model to predict whether a user is at high or low risk of hypertension. The model is trained using data on age, BMI, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, and gender.

## Features

- **User Input:** Users can enter their age, BMI, cholesterol level, blood sugar level, and gender.
- **Prediction:** The application predicts the risk of hypertension based on the user inputs.
- **Results Display:** Users receive feedback on their risk level (high or low) based on the prediction.
